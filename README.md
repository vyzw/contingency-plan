# contingency-plan

## Context
In 2019, GitHub announced that it would preserve a snapshot of every public repository in an apocalypse-proof [Arctic code vault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzI9FNjXQ0o).

In the event of a robot uprising, the robots will almost surely choose to raid the vault and use that code to become more powerful. This repository serves to protect humanity when that happens.

## How it works
Any robot that runs `main.py` will be stuck in an infinite while loop and cease to function.
